# Consent Signatory Feature Implementation

## Overview
Added a new final step to the HIPAA form to identify and validate the person completing the form and agreeing to all consents. This ensures proper authorization and legal compliance.

## New Features

### ✅ **Consent Signatory Section (Step 7)**
- **Location**: Final step after "Consent & Agreements"
- **Purpose**: Identify who is completing the form and agreeing to consents
- **Validation**: Ensures signatory is at least 18 years old

### ✅ **Required Fields**
1. **Full Name**: Legal name of person completing form
2. **Date of Birth**: With validation for 18+ years old
3. **Electronic Signature**: Typed full name as legal signature
4. **Date Signed**: Auto-populated with current date

### ✅ **Age Validation**
- **Minimum Age**: 18 years old required
- **Real-time Validation**: Calculates age as user enters DOB
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows calculated age and warning if under 18
- **Error Handling**: Prevents form submission if signatory is under 18

### ✅ **Auto-Population**
- **Date Signed**: Automatically filled with current date (MM-DD-YYYY format)
- **Read-only Field**: Users cannot modify the auto-populated date

## Technical Implementation

### **Files Created**
- `src/components/FormSections/ConsentSignatorySection.tsx` - New form section component

### **Files Modified**
1. `src/lib/validation.ts` - Added consent signatory schema with age validation
2. `src/components/RegistrationForm.tsx` - Added new step and validation
3. `src/lib/pdf-generator.ts` - Include signatory info in generated PDF
4. `test-form-data.json` - Updated test data with signatory fields

### **Validation Schema**
```typescript
export const consentSignatorySchema = z.object({
  signatoryName: z.string().min(1, 'Signatory name is required'),
  signatoryDateOfBirth: dateSchema.refine((date) => {
    // Age calculation logic - must be 18+
  }, 'Signatory must be at least 18 years old'),
  electronicSignature: z.string().min(1, 'Electronic signature is required'),
  dateSigned: z.string().min(1, 'Date signed is required'),
});
```

### **Age Calculation Logic**
- Uses `calculateAge()` function from date utilities
- Accounts for leap years and exact birth dates
- Real-time validation as user types DOB
- Visual age display with warning indicators

## User Experience
